# PB3D-LOGIN-SYSTEM

The purpose of this code is to create a three-factor authentication system using Python without JavaScript. Additionally, if you want to add a dashboard and a wrong login page, you need to create "WrongLoginIndex.html" and "Dashboard.html" files in the templates folder. Also, since the three-factor system will work with email, you need to generate a Google app key.
